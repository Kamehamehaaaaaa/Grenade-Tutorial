# Grenade-Tutorial
A grenade blast feature created using Particle System

**Project Description:**
In this Unity 2021 project, I created a small tutorial of a grenade blast explosion by using standard particle effect asset in Unity and along with this I implemented camera shake effect from cinemachine for immersive experience. For the test, a simple environment was created with crates and bottles.
